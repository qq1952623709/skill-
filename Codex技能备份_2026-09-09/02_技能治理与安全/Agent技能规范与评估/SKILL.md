## 1. Agent Skills Specification

### 1.1 Directory Structure

Every skill is a folder containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation loaded on demand
├── assets/           # Optional: templates, images, data files
└── LICENSE.txt       # Optional: license file
```

### 1.2 SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain **YAML frontmatter** followed by **Markdown body**.

#### Required frontmatter fields

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|:-------:|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`) only. Must NOT start or end with a hyphen. Must NOT contain consecutive hyphens (`--`). **Must match the parent directory name.** |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Must describe BOTH what the skill does AND when to use it. This is the primary mechanism the agent uses to decide whether to activate the skill. |

#### Optional frontmatter fields

| Field | Constraints |
|-------|-------------|
| `license` | License name or reference to a bundled license file (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`). Keep it short. |
| `compatibility` | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access). Only include if your skill has specific requirements. |
| `metadata` | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata. Use reasonably unique key names to avoid conflicts. |
| `allowed-tools` | Space-separated string of pre-approved tools the skill may use. Experimental — support varies between agent implementations. |

#### Name field rules (detailed)

```text
VALID names:
  mermaid              ✅ lowercase only
  roll-dice            ✅ lowercase + hyphen
  skill-awesome        ✅ lowercase + hyphen

INVALID names:
  My-Skill             ❌ uppercase
  -skill               ❌ starts with hyphen
  skill-               ❌ ends with hyphen
  skill--awesome       ❌ consecutive hyphens
  skill_name           ❌ underscore
  123skill             ❌ starts with digit (no, actually digits ARE allowed)
```

#### Body content rules

- No format restrictions — write whatever helps the agent perform the task.
- **Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines / 5000 tokens.** Move detailed reference material to `references/`.
- Recommended sections: step-by-step instructions, examples of inputs and outputs, common edge cases.

### 1.3 Progressive Disclosure

Agents load skills progressively in three stages:

| Stage | What loads | Token cost | When |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Discovery** | Only `name` + `description` | ~100 tokens | Agent startup |
| **Activation** | Full `SKILL.md` body | <5000 tokens (recommended) | Task matches description |
| **Execution** | `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/` | On demand | As needed during execution |

**Key implications for skill design:**
- The `description` carries the entire burden of triggering — if it doesn't convey when the skill is useful, the agent won't know to reach for it.
- Keep `SKILL.md` focused on core instructions. Tell the agent **when to load** reference files, not just that they exist: "Read `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status code."
- Avoid deeply nested reference chains — keep references one level deep from SKILL.md.

## 2. Best Practices for Skill Design

### 2.1 Start from Real Expertise

Do NOT ask an LLM to generate a skill from its general training knowledge — this produces vague, generic procedures. Ground skills in real, domain-specific context:

- **Extract from a hands-on task**: Complete a real task, then extract the reusable pattern. Capture steps that worked, corrections you made, input/output formats, and project-specific context.
- **Synthesize from existing project artifacts**: Internal documentation, runbooks, API specifications, code review comments, version control history, real-world failure cases.

### 2.2 Spend Context Wisely

Every token in your skill competes for the agent's attention.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Add what the agent lacks (project conventions, domain procedures, edge cases) | Explain what the agent already knows (what a PDF is, how HTTP works) |
| Design coherent units (one skill = one cohesive workflow) | Scope too narrowly (many skills for one task) or too broadly (hard to trigger precisely) |
| Aim for moderate detail (concise stepwise guidance + working examples) | Be overly comprehensive (agent struggles to extract what's relevant) |
| Structure large skills with progressive disclosure | Put everything in SKILL.md |

Ask yourself about each piece of content: **"Would the agent get this wrong without this instruction?"** If no, cut it.

### 2.3 Calibrate Control

Match the specificity of instructions to the fragility of the task:

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Multiple valid approaches, task tolerates variation | Give the agent freedom. Explain *why* rather than rigid directives. |
| Operations are fragile, consistency critical, specific sequence required | Be prescriptive. Use exact commands, explicit sequences. |
| Multiple tools/approaches could work | Pick a default and mention alternatives briefly. Provide defaults, not menus. |
| Teaching a class of problems | Favor procedures ("how to approach") over declarations ("what to produce for one instance"). |

### 2.4 Effective Instruction Patterns

**Gotchas sections** — the highest-value content in many skills. Environment-specific facts that defy reasonable assumptions:

```markdown
## Gotchas
- The `users` table uses soft deletes. Queries must include `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.
- The user ID is `user_id` in the database, `uid` in the auth service, and `accountId` in the billing API. All three refer to the same value.
```

**Output format templates** — more reliable than prose descriptions. Agents pattern-match well against concrete structures:

```markdown
## Report structure
Use this template, adapting sections as needed:

# [Analysis Title]
## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview]
## Key findings
- Finding 1 with supporting data
## Recommendations
1. Specific actionable recommendation
```

**Checklists for multi-step workflows** — helps the agent track progress and avoid skipping steps:

```markdown
## Workflow
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze input
- [ ] Step 2: Create plan
- [ ] Step 3: Validate plan
- [ ] Step 4: Execute
- [ ] Step 5: Verify output
```

**Validation loops** — instruct the agent to validate before proceeding:

```markdown
1. Make your edits
2. Run validation: `python scripts/validate.py output/`
3. If validation fails: review error, fix issues, re-run validation
4. Only proceed when validation passes
```

### 2.5 "When to use" / "When NOT to use" sections

Include a clear "When NOT to use" section with near-miss boundaries — scenarios that share keywords or concepts with your skill but need a different skill. This prevents false triggering.

---

## 3. Description Optimization

### 3.1 Principles for Effective Descriptions

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Use imperative phrasing** | "Use this skill when..." not "This skill does..." The agent is deciding whether to act. |
| **Focus on user intent, not implementation** | Describe what the user is trying to achieve, not the skill's internal mechanics. |
| **Err on the side of being pushy** | Explicitly list contexts where the skill applies, including cases where the user doesn't name the domain directly. |
| **Keep it concise** | A few sentences to a short paragraph. Hard limit: 1024 characters. |

### 3.2 Testing Description Triggering

Create **eval queries** (~20) — realistic user prompts labeled with whether they should or shouldn't trigger your skill. Design:

- **Should-trigger queries**: Vary phrasing (formal/casual/typos), explicitness (naming the domain vs describing the need), detail level, and complexity.
- **Should-not-trigger queries**: Focus on **near-misses** — queries that share keywords with your skill but actually need something different. These are the most valuable negative test cases.

Run each query 3+ times (model behavior is nondeterministic) and compute a **trigger rate**. Use a train/validation split (60%/40%) to avoid overfitting.

---

## 4. Script Safety Guidelines

When a skill bundles executable scripts in `scripts/` or instructs the agent to run shell commands:

### Required

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Non-interactive** | No prompts waiting for stdin/TTY. All inputs via flags, environment variables, or stdin explicitly. |
| **`--help` available** | Prints usage instructions and examples. This is the primary way an agent learns the script's interface. |
| **Clear error messages** | Say what failed, what was expected, and what to try next. "Error: `--format` must be one of: json, csv, table. Received: 'xml'" |
| **No secrets** | No hardcoded tokens, keys, or passwords. No logging of secrets. |
| **Safe defaults** | Destructive operations require explicit `--force` or `--confirm` flags. |

### Recommended

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Structured output** | `--format json` option. Data to stdout, diagnostics to stderr. |
| **Idempotency** | Repeated runs do not corrupt state. "Create if not exists" over "create and fail on duplicate". |
| **`--dry-run` support** | For destructive or stateful operations, let the agent preview what will happen. |
| **Predictable output size** | Default to summary; support pagination flags if output can be large. |
| **Meaningful exit codes** | Distinct exit codes for different failure types. Document them in `--help`. |

### Self-contained scripts (recommended pattern)

Use inline dependency declarations so scripts can run with a single command:

- **Python (PEP 723)**: `# /// script` / `# dependencies = [...]` / `# ///` → run with `uv run`
- **Deno**: `import from "npm:package@version"` → run with `deno run`
- **Bun**: `import from "package@version"` → run with `bun run`

## 5. Evaluation Frameworks

### 5.1 Official Rubric (agentskills.io)

Five inspection dimensions from the official specification:

| Dimension | What it checks | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Spec compliance** | Frontmatter fields, name/directory match, field format validity | Must |
| **Progressive disclosure** | SKILL.md conciseness, references with trigger conditions, no deep chains | Should |
| **Description quality** | User-intent language, trigger/not-trigger boundaries | Should |
| **Script readiness** | Non-interactive CLI, `--help`, structured output, safe defaults | Conditional |
| **Security hygiene** | No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious download/exfiltration instructions | Must |

### 5.2 TRACE Model (SkillHub)

Five-dimension quality model for evaluating skills:

| Dimension | Core question |
|-----------|--------------|
| **T · Trust** | "Can I safely use it?" — permissions, secrets, dependency risks, third-party scan evidence, China network compatibility |
| **R · Reliability** | "Can I use it consistently?" — input constraints, failure feedback, validation loops, repeatability |
| **A · Adaptability** | "Should I use it in this scenario?" — boundary clarity, trigger precision, near-miss handling |
| **C · Convention** | "Can it be understood, maintained, and reused?" — structure, progressive disclosure, templates, naming consistency |
| **E · Effectiveness** | "Did it actually solve the problem?" — output correctness, coverage, reusability, improvement over no-skill baseline |
